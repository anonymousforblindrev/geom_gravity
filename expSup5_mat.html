<h1>Description of the study</h1>
<p>To generalize our findings and to further test our theory, four
replication (supplementary) experiments were conducted in which the
shape of the objects was triangular instead of L-shaped. Some of these
studies also employed a different response format than that of our main
studies. In Supplementary Experiments~4-6 (which were set in a 3D
context without manipulation, a 3D context with manipulation, and 2D
context respectively), participants could choose between three answers
instead of two. As before, they could say that one or the other of the
new objects was emitting a different intensity of alpha rays.
Additionally, they had the option to say that they were absolutely
uncertain about which object was emitting a different intensity of alpha
rays. We also conducted a pilot study (with <span
class="math inline">\(N~=210\)</span> subjects). The only difference was
that subjects in the pilot study were asked to write short explanations
of their choices.</p>
<div id="method" class="section level2">
<h2>Method</h2>
<div id="participants" class="section level3">
<h3>Participants</h3>
<p>Four hundred and twenty participants (<span
class="math inline">\(n~60\)</span> per theoretically relevant
condition, <span class="math inline">\(M_{age}~= 38.28\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(SD_{age}~= 13.87\)</span>, age range <span
class="math inline">\(18-87\)</span>) were recruited via the online
platform Prolific (). Inclusion criteria were: age range between 18 and
99 years old, a subject’s approval rate concerning participation in
previous studies of at least 90%. To ensure that subjects could read and
understand the materials, we excluded subjects who received no formal
education. Participants received a link that led them directly to the
online experiment, which was created with the JSPsych framework (<a
href="https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/">https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/</a>).
Subjects received a monetary reward for their participation. Subjects
were not informed about the hypotheses that we tested. We decided to
test about half as many subjects than in our main experiments and
stopped data collection after <span class="math inline">\(n~=60\)</span>
subjects per (transformation) condition.</p>
</div>
<div id="design-materials-and-procedure" class="section level3">
<h3>Design, materials, and procedure</h3>
<p>The experiment had the same seven between-subjects conditions as our
other studies. Conditions differed with respect to the target
geometrical transformation. A demo of the experiment can be run <a
href="supplementary_studies/expSupp5/experiment_files/task_local_demo/Exp_demo.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>After some general information and confirmation questions, subjects
read the following scenario description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientists on an extraterrestrial mission have landed on a foreign
planet not so different from planet Earth. They plan to use their two
robotic rovers to explore the desert in which they have landed. The
rovers have a robotic arm with which they can pick up objects from the
ground and turn them around for careful examination. An illustration of
the two identical rovers is shown below.</p>
<p><img
src="supplementary_studies/expSupp5/experiment_files/task_local_demo/img/robot_intro.svg" />
<br> <br></p>
If you have studied the information thoroughly, please click “Continue”
to proceed.
</blockquote>
<p>On the next screen they were given more information about how the
robotic arms work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The robotic arm of the rovers has different joints allowing it to
reach down to the ground. The arm also has a rotatable front part with a
robotic claw that allows it to pick up objects and turn them in
different directions. An illustration is shown below.</p>
<p><img
src="supplementary_studies/expSupp5/experiment_files/task_local_demo/img/robot_arm_intro.svg" />
<br> <br></p>
If you have studied the information thoroughly, please click “Continue”
to proceed.
</blockquote>
<p>On a novel screen, subjects were shown illustrations of the robotic
arms in action:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before the scientists send the rovers into the desert, they want to
check if the robotic arms are working correctly. As a test, they put
their two coffee mugs on the ground and command the two robots to pick
them up and move them around for a while. Below you can see pictures of
this test. The first one shows the two mugs on the ground. The second
picture shows that both robots successfully picked up a mug. The robots
seem fit to explore the desert.</p>
<p><img
src="supplementary_studies/expSupp5/experiment_files/task_local_demo/img/arm_test_01.svg" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Subjects then proceeded to another screen on which the first
geometric (triangular) object was shown. The text the picture they were
shown are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shortly after the rovers had started exploring the desert, the
scientists notice an unfamiliar black object lying on the ground. They
command one of their two rovers to approach the object. As the rover
comes closer, its radiation detector starts buzzing. It tells the
scientists that the object is emitting alpha rays. They command the
rover to pick the object up and move it around for a while. While the
rover is still moving the object around, the scientists take a picture.
Below you can see the photograph they took.</p>
<p><img
src="supplementary_studies/expSupp5/experiment_files/task_local_demo/img/3D_Identity_left.svg" />
<br> <br></p>
<p>If you have studied the information thoroughly, please click
“Continue” to proceed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was counterbalanced between subjects whether the robotic arm was
holding the object from the left side or the right side. Subjects then
proceeded to the test screen, where two objects were shown (the example
below comes from the “size” condition):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Later on, the scientists spot two new objects lying on the ground. As
their rovers approach these two novel objects, their radiation detectors
show that one of these objects is emitting the same intensity of alpha
rays as the initial object you have seen on the previous screen. The
other object, by contrast, is emitting a different intensity of alpha
rays than the initial object you’ve seen on the previous screen. The
scientists command the rovers to pick the two objects up and move them
around for a while. While the rovers are still moving the objects
around, the scientists take a picture. Below you can see the photograph
they took.</p>
<p><img
src="supplementary_studies/expSupp5/experiment_files/task_local_demo/img/Left_Y_Symmetry_Big.svg" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether the Y-Reflection object was displayed on the right or the
left was counterbalanced between subjects. On the same screen below the
picture, subjects were asked the following test question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to your intuition: Which of the two new objects above do
you think is emitting the different intensity of alpha rays compared to
the initial object?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They could select between three options in this study: “Rather the
left object” vs. “I’m absolutely uncertain” vs. “Rather the right
object”.</p>
<p>Subjects then provided demographic data, had the chance to report any
technical issues they might have experienced, and then finished the
experiment on a short debriefing screen.</p>
<p>We had also conducted a pilot study with half as many subjects. The
pilot study was identical until after the main test question. Unlike
subjects in the main study, subjects of the pilot study were asked to
write a short explanation of their choice.</p>

<div id="results-and-discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>Results and discussion</h2>
<p>The knitted analysis file can be accessed <a
href="supplementary_studies/expSupp5/data_and_analyses/Analysis.html">here</a>.
Subjects’ selections in the different transformation conditions are
shown in the following graph:</p>
<p><img
src="supplementary_studies/expSupp5/data_and_analyses/selections_dodged.svg" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The graph shows that, as predicted by the theory, the proportions of
Not-Y-Reflection choices dropped in comparison to our studies without
external object manipulation. However, less of a drop occurred in the
“Size” and “Shape” conditions, which was also predicted.</p>
<p>A graph that averages over the different transformations is shown
next:</p>
<p><img
src="supplementary_studies/expSupp5/data_and_analyses/main_averaged_over_transformations.svg" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The next graph shows subjects’ choices that we observed in the pilot
study (<span class="math inline">\(N~= 210\)</span>), which differed
from the main study only after the main test screen:</p>
<p><img
src="supplementary_studies/expSupp5/data_and_analyses/pilot_selections_dodged.svg" />
<br></p>
<p>This graph shows that the results were very similar to those of the
main study. Again, the proportion of Not-Y-Reflection choices went down,
but not in the Size and the Shape conditions. We therefore decided to
aggregate the data from both studies. The aggregated results are shown
below:</p>
<p><img
src="supplementary_studies/expSupp5/data_and_analyses/pilot_and_main_selections_dodged.svg" /></p>
<p>The aggregated graph averaging over the transformation conditions is
